    "\n",
    "#### **Indices Tracked**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compensation Pressure Index (Blue)**: Tracks wage pressure from rising pay, wage growth, and workforce participation.\n",
    "* **Labor Market Flow Index (Red)**: Measures job movement (quits, layoffs, temp hiring).\n",
    "* **Labor Tightness Index (Orange)**: Reflects competition for workers and hiring confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All three indices dip significantly during the 2008‚Äì2009 recession and again during COVID-19 (2020).\n",
    "* Post-2020 shows a spike, particularly in **Labor Tightness** and **Compensation Pressure**, indicating a hot labor market.\n",
    "* 2023‚Äì2025 shows some cooling, especially in job flows and tightness, but compensation pressures remain moderately elevated.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Indices Tracked**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Labor Distress Index (Red)**: High values reflect underemployment and job market congestion.\n",
    "* **Hiring Friction Index (Blue)**: Captures mismatch in filling open roles.\n",
    "* **Hiring Latency Index (Orange)**: Shows delays between job postings and hires.\n",
    "* **Latent Labor Slack Index (Green)**: Proxy for hidden slack like part-time underemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Labor Distress** peaked post-2008 and briefly in 2020, consistent with downturns.\n",
    "* **Friction and latency** have remained mildly elevated post-COVID, indicating slower employer responsiveness.\n",
    "* **Latent slack** is relatively stable, but overall supply-side pressure eased significantly after the COVID spike.\n",

    "* **Frozen Market Index** shown on the right plots a z-scored composite from 2006 to 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Index spikes in 2009 and again in 2020, aligning with major labor market disruptions.\n",
    "* Sustained downward trend from 2010 to 2019 indicates a more fluid and healthier labor market.\n",
    "* Post-COVID freeze was short but sharp, with recovery ongoing into 2025.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Confirms the dual peaks in market freeze during the 2008 Great Recession and the 2020 COVID crisis.\n",
    "* Shows recovery arcs post-recession, with 2023‚Äì2025 levels still below zero, indicating gradual return to market normalcy.\n",

    "Great ‚Äî you've uploaded a Jupyter notebook titled **`Demand_vs_Supply.ipynb`**, which likely includes labor market indicators and the Frozen Market Index. Here's a step-by-step outline for how to **forecast how ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù the job market will be in the future** using time series modeling.\n",

    "### üîÅ Step-by-Step Forecasting Pipeline for Frozen Market Index (FMI)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Load & Explore the Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the relevant time series columns, particularly:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `observation_date`\n",
    "  * `Frozen_Market_Index` or `Frozen_Market_Index_z`\n",
    "  * Related indicators like `Labor_Tightness_Index`, `Labor_Distress_Index`, `Hiring_Friction_Index`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Check for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nulls\n",
    "* Frequency (monthly? quarterly?)\n",
    "* Trends & seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert `observation_date` to datetime and set it as the index.\n",
    "* Resample to monthly if needed (`.resample(\"M\").mean()`).\n",
    "* Handle missing values (interpolate or fill).\n",
    "* Optionally smooth noisy signals with a rolling mean or z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Create Lag Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture time dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for lag in range(1, 5):\n",
    "    df[f'FMI_lag_{lag}'] = df['Frozen_Market_Index'].shift(lag)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also lag other indicators (e.g. `Labor_Tightness_Index_lag1`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Choose a Forecasting Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ARIMA/SARIMA** ‚Äì univariate\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Best for baseline FMI-only forecasts\n",
    "2. **VAR (Vector AutoRegression)** ‚Äì multivariate\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use FMI + labor indicators\n",
    "3. **XGBoost Regressor or RandomForestRegressor**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Tabular supervised regression\n",
    "   * Needs lagged features as predictors\n",
    "4. **Prophet (by Meta)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Simple, interpretable, additive model\n",
    "   * Great for seasonality & trend analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 5: Train/Test Split**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a **time-aware split**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "train = df.loc[:'2023-12']\n",
    "test = df.loc['2024-01':]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 6: Train & Predict**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with **ARIMA**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\n",
    "\n",
    "model = ARIMA(train['Frozen_Market_Index'], order=(3,1,2))\n",
    "model_fit = model.fit()\n",
    "forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=len(test))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or **with XGBoost**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from xgboost import XGBRegressor\n",
    "\n",
    "X_train = train.drop(columns=['Frozen_Market_Index'])\n",
    "y_train = train['Frozen_Market_Index']\n",
    "X_test = test.drop(columns=['Frozen_Market_Index'])\n",
    "\n",
    "model = XGBRegressor()\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "forecast = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 7: Evaluate**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* RMSE / MAE\n",
    "* Visual: Plot actual vs. predicted FMI\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.plot(test.index, test['Frozen_Market_Index'], label='Actual')\n",
    "plt.plot(test.index, forecast, label='Forecast')\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 8: Forecast Into the Future**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your model is performing well, generate future timestamps and forecast FMI into 2025+.\n",
    "\n",
    "With ARIMA:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "future_forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=12)  # 12 months ahead\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **SHAP** with XGBoost to interpret what indicators drive job market freezes\n",
    "* Use rolling-window retraining\n",
    "* Use PCA to reduce indicator dimensionality\n",
