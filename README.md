# Labor Market Friction & Freeze Dashboard

## Overview

### Business and Data Understanding

**Business Problem**
Traditional labor indicators (e.g., unemployment rate, job openings) often fail to explain the **underlying friction** in the labor market—why hiring slows, why participation drops, or why wage pressure exists even during full employment. Policymakers and businesses need a more **holistic, interpretable signal** to guide decisions during dynamic labor cycles.

**Primary Stakeholders**

* **Federal Reserve, Policy Researchers, and Think Tanks** – Diagnose slack, overheating, or freeze conditions in real time.
* **HR Executives & Business Leaders** – Detect labor market pressure points that affect hiring pipelines.
* **Journalists & Economic Analysts** – Gain clean visual narratives for public explanation.
* **Labor Economists & Academic Researchers** – Use multidimensional indicators for structural analysis.

**Objective**
Construct a **composite labor index framework** using interpretable components that measure:

* Labor demand (heat & pressure)
* Labor supply (slack & friction)
* Composite "freeze" risk over time
  Visualize these trends using Tableau for public and policy-facing storytelling.

## Data Understanding

**Sources**:

* BLS (JOLTS, CPS, CES)
* FRED via API or CSV downloads
* Custom proxies (e.g., Applicants per Job)

**Indicator Themes**:

* **Demand-Side**: Quits, Openings, Hires, Wage Growth, Participation
* **Supply-Side**: Underemployment, Involuntary Part-Time, Labor Slack, Hiring Delays

---

## Index Construction

### Demand-Side Indices

* **Labor Tightness Index**
  *Components:* Job Openings Rate, Hires Rate, Quits Rate
  *Interpretation:* Higher values = strong employer demand and worker confidence.

* **Compensation Pressure Index**
  *Components:* Real Wage Growth, Median Hourly Wage Growth, Prime-age Employment Ratio
  *Interpretation:* High = wage-driven hiring pressure.

* **Labor Market Flow Index**
  *Components:* Quits, Temp Help YoY, Separations
  *Interpretation:* High = fluid, dynamic labor movement.

---

### Supply-Side Indices

* **Labor Distress Index**
  *Components:* Unemployed, NILFWJN, Marginally Attached, Involuntary Part-Time, Applicants per Job
  *Interpretation:* High = widespread job-seeking friction.

* **Hiring Friction Index**
  *Components:* Openings per Hire, Layoffs per Opening
  *Interpretation:* High = mismatch between jobs and applicants.

* **Hiring Latency Index**
  *Components:* Openings per Hire, Median Weeks Unemployed
  *Interpretation:* High = long delays between job posting and fulfillment.

### 🧊 Frozen Market Index

**Formula**

```plaintext
Frozen Market Index = 
+ Labor_Distress_Index  
+ Hiring_Friction_Index  
+ Hiring_Latency_Index  
+ Latent_Labor_Slack_Index  
- Labor_Tightness_Index  
- Compensation_Pressure_Index  
- Labor_Market_Flow_Index
```

**Purpose:** Captures when labor market activity "freezes" due to high friction and low mobility.

---

## Modeling & Interpretability

### SHAP Analysis (Regional Housing Extension)

In a complementary housing market analysis:

* **Features**: Vacancy rate, affordability, new unit growth, rent/ownership burden
* **Target**: Regional Housing Market Index
* **Method**: `XGBoostRegressor` + `shap.Explainer`

**Outputs**:

* SHAP summary plots explain top drivers across metro areas
* Waterfall plots highlight city-level index explanations

---

## Visualization with Tableau

All index time series and SHAP results were **visualized in Tableau** to support:

* Interactive dashboards for supply vs. demand dynamics
* Annotated trendlines across business cycles (2006–2025)
* Recession shading (gray bands) to contextualize macroeconomic regimes
* Index formula callouts for transparency
* Region-level comparisons (in future stages)

Tableau was essential for delivering **clean, intuitive, and layered narratives** for analysts, journalists, and stakeholders.

---

## Evaluation

**Strengths**:

* Breaks away from siloed economic metrics
* Combines supply & demand views into a comprehensive signal
* SHAP integration explains model logic for regional housing stress
* Tableau enables accessible storytelling for public & professional users

**Limitations**:

* Z-scores require stable baseline behavior; sensitive to outliers
* Some proxies (e.g., NILFWJN, Temp Help) depend on data freshness
* Lagging indicators may mask near-term shifts

---

## Next Steps

1. **Forecast the Index Forward**
   Use ARIMA or XGBoost time-series models to project labor freeze risk.

2. **Metro-Level Freeze Index**
   Apply the same framework to regional data for localized heat/slack analysis.

3. **Add Real-Time Data Feeds**
   Automate updates via FRED API and BLS pipelines for near-live dashboarding.

4. **Policy Simulation Engine**
   Test what-if scenarios (e.g., "What if wage growth surges?" or "What if quits collapse?").

---

## Business Recommendations

1. **Use Composite Indices to Guide Policy**
   Fed governors and state labor offices should monitor the Frozen Market Index alongside inflation and GDP.

2. **Warn of Freeze Before It Hits**
   Rising distress + declining flows signal hiring paralysis—enable preemptive interventions.

3. **Improve Hiring Pipeline Metrics**
   Companies should track their own "hiring latency" to diagnose internal friction.

---

## Conclusion

The Frozen Market Index transforms complex labor dynamics into a clear, actionable signal. Through composite z-score modeling, SHAP interpretability, and rich Tableau visualization, this framework provides a powerful tool for diagnosing and communicating labor market shifts. It’s built for policymakers, practitioners, and analysts looking to bridge data complexity with insight-driven action.
